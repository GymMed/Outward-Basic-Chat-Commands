    <summary>Follow</summary>
Uses Unity’s <code>NavMeshPath</code> to calculate a path and simulates character
movement input to begin following another character. Following is automatically
canceled when the follower starts moving manually.<br>

**Usage:**
- Type <code>/follow</code> to follow a random nearby character (starting from
  the local player).
- Type <code>/follow characterName</code> to follow a specific character.
